# Bubble Sort
  Bubble Sort is the most simple sorting algorithm to implement.

## Operation

  - Compare adjacent pair values  and change if you are in a wrong place
  - Moves one position at a time, the highest value in the unclassified portion of an array to the correct position
  - Repeat this process until all of it is sorted

## Pros x Against

### Pros
 - Simple Implementation
 - This algorithm don't require extra memory

 ### Against
 - The average time is quadratic(n²) what means that is very slow to sorting registers
 - Bad results when the array have many items because needs O(n²) steps for each n element to sorting
- Indicated for academic purposes, but not feasible for real case applications

## Complexity
| Sorting Algorithm |Best Time| Average Time | Best Time
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|
| BubbleSort|  O(n) | O(n²)|O(n²)
