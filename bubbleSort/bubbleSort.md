# Bubble Sort
  BubbleSort is the most simple sorting algorithm to implement

## Pros x Against

### Pros
 - Simple Implementation
 - This algorithm don't require extra memory
 
 ### Against
 - The average time is quadratic(n²) what means that is very slow to sorting registers
-

## Complexity
| Sorting Algorithm |Best Time| Average Time | Best Time
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|
| BubbleSort|  O(n) | O(n²)|O(n²)
