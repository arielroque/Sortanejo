# Sortanejo

Sortings algorithms described and implemented from scratch in Python

## :pushpin: Sortings Algorithms

- [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/arielroque/Sortanejo/blob/master/bubble_sort/README.md)

## :books: Basics Concepts 

### Classification
 - #### Internal Sorting
     The file to be sorted fits all in the primary memory and the registers can be immediately accessed
  
 - #### External Sorting
     The file to be sorted dont fits all in the primary memory and the registers can be accessed by blocks or sequentially

### Stable vs Unstable

   - #### Stable 
       The algorithm preserve the order of the elements with same keys when is executing the sorting.  **Ex:** Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort
       
   - #### Unstable  
     The algorithm not necessarily  preserve the order of the elements with same keys when is executing the sorting. therefore, two equals elements can appear with different order. **Ex:** Merge Sort and Quick Sort
